# QFT simulations

This is still work in progress.

- main.cpp (temporary filename): Simulation of a 1+1D scalar field with Heatbath and Over-Relaxation algorithm. 
- scalar1d.hpp/cpp: Class for simulating a 1+1D scalar field. Contains methods for Heatbath and Overrelaxation algorithms. May add HMC (Hamiltonian/Hybrid Monte Carlo) algorithm later on.

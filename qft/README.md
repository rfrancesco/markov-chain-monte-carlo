# QFT simulations

This is still work in progress.

1+1D Scalar Field:
- thermo.cpp: Simulation of a 1+1D scalar field with Heatbath and Over-Relaxation algorithm. Measures energy density, pressure and trace anomaly.
- spectrum.cpp: Same as thermo, but measures the wall-wall correlators for measuring the mass and energy spectrum.
- scalar1d.hpp/cpp: Class for simulating a 1+1D scalar field. Contains methods for Heatbath and Overrelaxation algorithms. May add HMC (Hamiltonian/Hybrid Monte Carlo) algorithm later on.
